# NFT Collection Distribution

This go module makes it easy to visualize the distribution of an NFTs ownership.  Using this data you're able to make more reliable purchases of NFTs as a more even distribution often indicates a more desirable NFT and a vibrant community.

## How to run it

You'll need to install golang v1.14 or greater with `go modules` enabled.  There's plenty of info on how to do that on their [install page](https://go.dev/doc/install).

Once you have golang installed and working you'll need to do the following

- clone this repository
- run `go get` to install all necessary dependencies
- run `go run .` to run the application
